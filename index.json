I managed to resolve this but the rabbit hole led me to rediscover Cloudflare Pages.\nI still love and recommend GitHub Pages, with a simple GitHub Action you can deploy your project and even make use of custom domains.\nAnyway, for my use case, the top alternatives were Cloudflare Pages and Netlify. I currently manage domains on Cloudflare making it the obvious choice. Who knows, I might switch to Netlify in the future but time will tell.\nSome of the benefits of Cloudflare Pages include:\nFast site performance on the Cloudflare network. Easy to add a custom domain especially so if you use Cloudflare for domain management. Free universal SSL certificate with any plan. Ability to have preview deployments before rolling to production. The process of switching over was smooth. I connected Cloudflare Pages with my Git repository, set up build settings (just selecting Hugo as my framework) and deployed it. That easy! In my case, to setup a custom domain, Cloudflare simply added the necessary DNS records automatically.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s the update, for a guide on setting up Cloudflare Pages, have a look at Cloudflare Docs or this YouTube Video\n","date":"18 August 2023","permalink":"/switched-to-cloudflare-pages/","section":"Posts","summary":"This website has migrated from GitHub Pages to Cloudflare Pages","title":"Switched to Cloudflare Pages"},{"content":"","date":"18 August 2023","permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"","date":"18 August 2023","permalink":"/categories/updates/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Updates"},{"content":"","date":"14 August 2023","permalink":"/tags/activitypub/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"ActivityPub"},{"content":"","date":"14 August 2023","permalink":"/tags/at-protocol/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"AT Protocol"},{"content":"","date":"14 August 2023","permalink":"/categories/opinion/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Opinion"},{"content":"","date":"14 August 2023","permalink":"/tags/social-media/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Social Media"},{"content":"","date":"14 August 2023","permalink":"/tags/social-networking-protocol/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Social Networking Protocol"},{"content":"On 7th October 2022, Elon Musk concluded his purchase of Twitter and it has been quite a journey since then. Reddit also had a moment of existential crisis but what can we do?\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take it back: the year is 2012, and my mother has a shiny new phone which I was glued to it. Behind her back, I joined Facebook and revelled in this new world, all the while trying to be discreet. This did not last long, but surprisingly, I was not scolded. We had a talk of how I should use it and it was free rein from there.\nCue in a spree of joining every imaginable social media platform. It was love at first sight when I created my first Twitter account in 2013. TV shows of the period instilled the bad habit of tweeting every minute, and to this day, I still get tagged in those old cringe tweets.\nGoogle+ came onto the scene and I have to admit that was one of the best platforms, alongside Twitter, if not the best.\nBlogging became a huge thing and I jumped right in. However, one thing I regret is deleting my old blogs. I understand how cathartic that could have been but I have come to appreciate the importance of maintaining an archive where you can revisit your earlier work and perhaps find joy in observing your progress (or lack thereof) over time.\nFacebook faced the Cambridge Analytica scandal and consequently I deleted most of my accounts in 2018/19 but replaced some with a clear focus on privacy.\nWe circle back to Elon\u0026rsquo;s takeover of Twitter and alternative platforms like Mastodon rise but this time I\u0026rsquo;m not hasty in joining them.\nMeta capitalised on Twitter\u0026rsquo;s issues by launching Threads, and technically, every Instagram user already had an account. Everyone and their dog gave it a try, but to me, it felt like it was launched prematurely. Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, it was great but it lacked a lot of features. Meta wasn\u0026rsquo;t as aggressive as I expected in achieving feature parity with Twitter and building upon that.\nDuring the same week, I got an invite into BlueSky and it was amazing. It was everything I had hoped for albeit the userbase was minuscule. It had, and still has, the same vibe as Twitter in its early days.\nWill these alternatives dethrone Twitter? Unlikely. Twitter remains the juggernaut that popularised \u0026lsquo;microblogging\u0026rsquo; and it will take a lot to bring it down. Perhaps Elon himself will do that.\nSo, what does the future hold? I don\u0026rsquo;t know but juggling between Twitter and its alternatives, along with other platforms can be tiring. Ideally, platforms would be interoperable.\nThis will likely be a battle between protocols rather than the apps themselves. For example, Mastodon is built on top of ActivityPub, which enjoys support of multiple companies, while BlueSky utilises the AT Protocol. If one of these protocols (or a new one) gains significant traction then the social networking landscape will change drastically. In theory, we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be tied to an organisation or a CEO which is quite exciting. Hopefully in the end we don’t all gravitate back towards a centralised platform.\nI, for one, hope personal websites make a comeback. A place that can be regarded as your home base.\n","date":"14 August 2023","permalink":"/state-of-social-media/","section":"Posts","summary":"Here\u0026rsquo;s my social media story and my hope for it\u0026rsquo;s future.","title":"State of Social Media and My Journey Through It"},{"content":"","date":"14 August 2023","permalink":"/categories/web/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Web"},{"content":"For the love of God, please stop installing bloatware on your computer. I have noticed that people have a tendency to install every software they stumble upon, despite the fact that modern operating systems have a lot of features built-in.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll use Windows as an example, as it has the largest market share and a lot of people have this tendency. For example, if all you do with zip files is extract them, then Windows has you covered - you don\u0026rsquo;t need WinRAR. Additionally, many people overlook the built-in disk cleanup utility provided by Windows. It\u0026rsquo;s a powerful tool to clean up temporary files, various clutter as well as chunks left after Windows updates. Why do you need a registry cleaner, a cleanup utility or some driver pack installer? It\u0026rsquo;s most likely just malware. Don\u0026rsquo;t even mention those free antivirus software like McAfee - they\u0026rsquo;re totally pointless.\nFinally, if you only open PDFs but don\u0026rsquo;t manipulate them, please don\u0026rsquo;t install that Adobe software or Nitro PDF just for that. It\u0026rsquo;s like trying to kill a bug with a car - your default browser has the capability to view PDFs.\nI could go on and on but that\u0026rsquo;s enough for now.\nPerhaps it\u0026rsquo;s a lack of understanding of newer applications and operating systems, or being stuck in the days of Windows Vista. Having a million apps will just slow down your computer, be a pain to update, or worse, be a potential cyber threat. Just don\u0026rsquo;t install bloat on your computer.\n","date":"19 May 2023","permalink":"/bloatware/","section":"Posts","summary":"Cut the bloat and embrace simplicity of default features.","title":"Enough with the Bloat"},{"content":"","date":"19 May 2023","permalink":"/tags/operating-systems/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Operating Systems"},{"content":"","date":"19 May 2023","permalink":"/tags/software/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Software"},{"content":"","date":"19 May 2023","permalink":"/tags/windows/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Windows"},{"content":"","date":"14 April 2023","permalink":"/tags/dns-request/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"DNS Request"},{"content":"","date":"14 April 2023","permalink":"/tags/firewall/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Firewall"},{"content":"","date":"14 April 2023","permalink":"/tags/load-balancing/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Load Balancing"},{"content":"","date":"14 April 2023","permalink":"/tags/networking/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Networking"},{"content":"","date":"14 April 2023","permalink":"/categories/technical/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Technical"},{"content":"Billions of people on earth open their browsers everyday and type their favourite website\u0026rsquo;s URL - be it a social media site or some news outlet. Depending on your internet speed, this might be a matter of milliseconds but have you ever wondered what happens behind the scenes? I\u0026rsquo;ll get into that, hint - it\u0026rsquo;s a lot.\nDNS Request Your browser does not know what \u0026lsquo;google.com\u0026rsquo; is so as soon a you hit enter, it tries to resolve this into an IP address - it does this using a DNS (Domain Name System) lookup. This is where your browser checks different locations for cached DNS data starting from its own cache, operating system, router and finally the DNS server at your Internet Service Provider (ISP). In the event the IP address of the website you want to visit can\u0026rsquo;t be found, your browser does a recursive DNS lookup where it asks multiple DNS servers around the internet which in turn ask other DNS servers until it gets the DNS record.\nAt this point the DNS record is cached so that future requests for the same domain can be resolved more quickly.\nFirewall Once the browser sends a request, before it gets to the server it will pass through a firewall.\nA firewall is a network security device that monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic and decides whether to allow or block specific traffic based on a defined set of security rules.\nIts main function is to protect the network from threat actors so when you type google.com, the request passes through the firewall on its way to Google\u0026rsquo;s servers where depending on the security rules access may be denied.\nBrowser Performs TCP 3-Way Handshake Packets from the browser are sent to the server the IP address connects to using transmission control protocol (TCP). This is because TCP/IP is reliable and ensures data is sent in the correct order with no packetloss which is crucial when trying to load a website.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s what happens:\nThe browser sends the initial packet with a SYN (SYNchronize) header bit to establish connection. (\u0026ldquo;Hey, are you available next Tuesday?\u0026rdquo;) Upon receiving, the web server sends back a SYN-ACK (SYNchronize-ACKnowledge). (\u0026ldquo;Hey, yes I am free.\u0026rdquo;) The browser send back ACK. (\u0026ldquo;A-Okay, let\u0026rsquo;s talk.\u0026rdquo;) That is the 3-way handshake after which a socket is created. This is a two way communication link that facilitates transfer of data.\nMost websites have migrated to HTTPS which encrypts the web traffic so if you had typed http://www.google.com, the web server will return a 301 error code for Permanent Redirect. The browser will be redirected to https://www.google.com but it will first send a FIN packet, the server will respond with ACK and the socket is closed afterwhich the browser will attempt to connect to the redirected link.\nThe DNS request and the 3-way handshake happen again as well as a SSL/TLS handshake. This is a negotiation between two parties on a network to establish the details of their connection. It determines what version of SSL/TLS will be used in the session, which cipher suite will encrypt communication, verifies the server (and sometimes also the client), and establishes that a secure connection is in place before transferring data.\nOther Concepts To Know Load Balancing A load balancer sits in front of a server and distributes network traffic across all servers capable of fulfilling those request. It does this through various load balancing methods but its ultimate goal is to ensure no single server is overloaded by maximizing speed and capacity.\nIt is important to know that it is very likely that the first connection to google.com was made to a load balancer instead of actual web servers due to the large amount of traffic they receive.\nIf a server goes down, traffic is sent ot the remaining servers and if a new server is added, the load balancer starts sending requests to it.\nWeb Servers vs. Application Servers In a typical deployment, a website that provides both static and dynamically generated content runs web servers for the static content and application servers to generate content dynamically.\nA web server is a computer program whose fundamental job is to accept and fulfill requests from clients for static content from a website (HTML pages, files, images, video, and so on).\nAn application server\u0026rsquo;s fundamental job is to provide its clients with access to what is commonly called business logic, which generates dynamic content; that is, it’s code that transforms data to provide the specialized functionality offered by a business, service, or application.\nAll in all, the two concepts differ but they are usually deployed together to fulfill the request of a user for a website\u0026rsquo;s content.\nFor the case of typing google.com into your browser, their web server will receive your request and process it, generate a response (static content) and send it back to the user\u0026rsquo;s browser to render the web page. The web server will also get in touch with the application server to generate search results and in some complex cases, it may need to make a request to a database server.\nDatabase Server A database server runs a Database Management System (DBMS) and provides database services to clients. Its main role is to receive requests from client machines, search for the required data, and pass back the results. It consists of physical hardware as well as the software that runs the database.\nIt is a crucial component in the client-server computing environment where it provides business-critical information requested by the client systems. This information is sent back to the user and their browser will render it.\nBrowser Renders The Content Once the browser has received the response from the servers, it inspects the response headers for information on how to render the resource.\nIn the response, there is a Content-Type header that tells the browser which resource it has received in the response body. For the case of a HTML file, the browser will render the structure of the page and if it gets other resources such as CSS, JavaScript or images, it will render them accordingly.\nSumming Up This is the simplified final flow:\nOn pressing enter, the browser finds the website\u0026rsquo;s IP address with the help of a DNS server. The browser then makes a connection with the web server (either directly or through a load balancer) using TCP/IP to send a copy of the website. All the while, the back and forth communication passes through firewalls and if everything is approved, the servers (web, application and database server) start sending the website\u0026rsquo;s content in small chunks (data packets). The browser assembles the small chunks and renders the page to the user. You have successfully landed on google.com or any other website after multiple steps that barely takes more than a second.\nResources Here are some resources for more information:\nAWS: What happens when you type a URL into your browser?

I learnt programming around 2015 but nothing too serious, heck, I used Notepad on Windows. By 2016, I got more into it, discovered Atom and immediately fell in love with it.\nIt was marketed towards the kind of person who would tinker with things to suite their needs. Superficially though, I also liked the default colour scheme - One Dark.\nAtom was my ride-or-die even though VS Code had gained some traction by now but that was until I joined uni in 2018. I noticed students who were more experienced than I was using VS Code, the least I could do was give it a try. I adopted it and it has been my preferred text editor. So what\u0026rsquo;s changed?\nWhy I Still Like VS Code Yes, I still like VS Code. I have it configured as best as I can to how I like, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to tweak so we could make a case for why I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t leave it.\nIt has an integrated terminal, an entire marketplace for extensions, easily syncs my settings and has lots of themes. Also, any new technology or programming language will most likely have a guide on how to setup VS Code for it. It can act like an IDE or a simple text editor.\nI still prefer using it for larger projects such as mobile development with Flutter because it gets the job done.\nThese and many more are the reasons why year on year, VS Code leads in various surveys.\nWhy Vim? My previous encounter with Vim was the classic, enter and get stuck trying to exit. That was until I enrolled for a Software Engineering course with ALx Africa and we had to use Vim full time.\nI watched a lot of tutorials on YouTube and one channel that kept popping up was ThePrimeagen. Using VS Code after watching him felt inefficient. I mean the dude was flying through, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t keep up but it inspired me.\nVim is minimal with great freedom on how maximal you want to make it. I mean minimalism is not the current trend but I still practice some of the learnings from it.\nCoupled with the fact that as a Linux user, I often use the terminal, Vim was essentially shouting my name.\nThe Switch My course forced me to dive headfirst into Vim since we had to SSH into remote servers and the terminal was our only option.\nWe had a two-week period to get the gist of things so my plan was to quickly learn the basics before slowly swimming to the deep end.\nVimtutor came to the rescue in learning Vim movements and other basic commands, it\u0026rsquo;s literally a program that runs you through a tutorial of vim.\nI later realised we didn\u0026rsquo;t need to SSH into ALx Africa\u0026rsquo;s servers, that was just an easier way to facilitate those who don\u0026rsquo;t use Linux or don\u0026rsquo;t have easy access to computers. At this point, I could use VS Code on my PC and forget about Vim but I had the itch from my Atom days to stick and tinker around.\nIt felt amazing to use Vim, maybe I\u0026rsquo;m better than everyone else 😂.\nHow\u0026rsquo;s the going? It\u0026rsquo;s been about 4 months now, and I\u0026rsquo;m not ThePrimeagen level but I feel comfortable with Vim.\nI mentioned Vim comes with great freedom on how maximal you want to make it, I started with the simple basics of adding line numbers, configuring indentation, syntax processing etc.\nThereafter, I discovered TJ Devries and opted to go with Neovim due to some good defaults it packs and the community behind it. I slowly added more to my config, setup plugins, language support and even migrated from Vimscript to Lua.\nCurrently I use it for most of my projects.\nConclusion So why I\u0026rsquo;m I ditching VS Code? I like the minimal nature of Vim, the fact it\u0026rsquo;s terminal-based, the endless configuration options and it\u0026rsquo;s just fun. Perhaps ditching is overexaggerating but I will use VS Code way less than I used to. Who knows, I might switch back to it in the far future.\nVim is a great tool but can be very overwhelming with its steep learning curve. The trick is to add things bit by bit as well as understanding what you add to you config rather than blindly copying someone\u0026rsquo;s setup. That being said, here\u0026rsquo;s my dotfiles for inspiration.\nIt is also an interesting and fun rabbit hole to go down from vanilla Vim to the variety of flavours. There\u0026rsquo;s always something to learn.\nTill next time, cheers.\nResources What is Vim?\n","date":"15 February 2023","permalink":"/why-im-leaving-vs-code-for-vim/","section":"Posts","summary":"VS Code is good enough but here\u0026rsquo;s why I prefer Vim.","title":"I'm Ditching VS Code"},{"content":"","date":"15 February 2023","permalink":"/tags/text-editors/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Text Editors"},{"content":"","date":"15 February 2023","permalink":"/tags/vim/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Vim"},{"content":"","date":"15 February 2023","permalink":"/tags/vs-code/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"VS Code"},{"content":"Here is a collection of other places you can find me and websites/articles I find interesting.

This is all fine and good but you can make it yours by adding a custom domain and still benefit from the free hosting.\nPrerequisites The only prerequisites are:\nOwn a domain or have access to one. Have a site making use of GitHub Pages. Have a look at how I created this site for free with Hugo and GitHub pages to get you started if you do not have a site up and running.\nFor the domain, you can buy yourself one on Namecheap or Google Domains or any other registrar. They are relatively inexpensive.\nUpdate Your DNS Settings I typically add my custom domain to GitHub Pages at the end after configuring my DNS settings.\nYour DNS records should point to USERNAME.github.io and NOT the repository name. Once set up, GitHub will figure out which page to serve. Configure a subdomain If you own a subdomain such asblog.example.com then all you have to do is:\nHead over to where you manage your DNS configurations (typically your registrar) Add a CNAME pointing to your GitHub Page. For my other blog, auto.insidemordecai.com, that meant adding a CNAME record called auto that points to insidemordecai.github.io I recommend leaving the TTL setting in Auto until you understand more about it then you can tweak to your liking.\nConfigure an apex domain For an apex domain such as example.com or this site, then the steps are:\nHead over to where you manage your DNS configurations (typically your registrar) Add four A records with the name as your apex domain (in my case, insidemordecai.com) that each point to GitHub Pages\u0026rsquo; IP addresses as seen here (just copy-paste). I recommend also setting up a configuration for a www subdomain as it is easy for someone to assume your site\u0026rsquo;s address starts as so. The steps for this are the same as above, for me that meant creating a CNAME record named www pointing to insidemordecai.github.io\nUpdate Your GitHub Repository Head over to your GitHub repository and navigate to the GitHub Pages settings. Under \u0026lsquo;Custom domain\u0026rsquo;, type your custom domain and click save. GitHub will check for the DNS configuration we made and your site should be live on this new address in a few. To not spook the visitors of your site when their browser warns them of an unsecure site, you can check the Enforce HTTPS box on this page.\nFix GitHub Actions Removing the CNAME File After adding your custom domain to the site\u0026rsquo;s repository, GitHub commits a CNAME file but if you have a GitHub Actions workflow then this file is deleted with every new change and your site is inaccessible.\nFor Hugo sites, we can fix this by:\nOn the root of our repository, create a directory called static Navigate into the new directory and create a file called CNAME Edit the file to have a single line that is just your custom domain, either your apex domain ( insidemordecai.com) or your subdomain ( auto.insidemordecai.com) Push your local changes to GitHub.

That was until I learnt of static site generators and their simplicity. This blog you are reading is made using Hugo and hosted on GitHub.\nHere is the process:\nInstalling Hugo Creating your new hugo site Building the site Hosting with GitHub Pages Installing Hugo This part may differ based on your development setup. I\u0026rsquo;d recommend Chocolatey for Windows and Homebrew for Mac but Hugo has documentation on the many installation methods. For Linux, Hugo is most likely on your distribution\u0026rsquo;s repository but you can check out the documentation.\nCreating Your New Hugo Site Open your console, navigate to where you want to save your site and run hugo new site . to create the site in the current directory. If you\u0026rsquo;d like to create the site in a new directory, run hugo new site SITE_NAME. Look for a Hugo theme and setup the site skeleton based on the theme\u0026rsquo;s documentation. I personally use Blowfish I recommend downloading themes as a Git Submodule as this will make it easier to update them. It\u0026rsquo;s also important to choose a theme with great documentation for your ease of use.\nBuilding The Site At this point we already have a skeleton of a site and we can run hugo server at the root of our site. This will also allow us to observe the changes we make and their effect. You can run hugo server -D if you want to test out with some draft posts as by default Hugo doesn\u0026rsquo;t show drafts.\nYour site is now available at localhost:1313\nGoogle as well as your theme\u0026rsquo;s documentation will be your friend from hereon. You can check out the exampleSite and other sites that use the same theme for inspiration.\nHosting with GitHub Pages Create a public GitHub repository named YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io but can use any other name. (we\u0026rsquo;ll get to that later)\nAs you might have noticed, when you run hugo or hugo server, some directories are created. These aren\u0026rsquo;t required and therefore we can create a .gitignore file and add /public and /resources to it.\nPush your changes to the GitHub repository we created.\nSet up GitHub Actions by creating a file in .github/workflows/gh-pages.yml. Copy the content of the file from this section of the Hugo documentation.\nWhat this does is once GitHub notices changes to your main branch, it will perform a set of actions to publish your site to gh-pages branch.\nPush the GitHub Actions file and you\u0026rsquo;re done.\nYour site is now live at YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io. If you chose to use a different repository name then your site is live at YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/REPOSITORY_NAME\nSome YouTube channels that I found helpful when creating my site were Chris Stayte, Eric Murphy and Luke Smith.\nTill next time, feel free to reach out.

For those running Intel 5th Gen (Broadwell) and above pick the intel-media-driver option while those running older processors can opt for libva-intel-driver.\nFor more information, check out the RPM Fusion website.\nAdd Extra Fonts sudo dnf install fira-code-fonts \u0026#39;mozilla-fira*\u0026#39; \u0026#39;google-roboto*\u0026#39; -y For compatibility, Microsoft fonts may be needed:\nsudo dnf install -y curl cabextract xorg-x11-font-utils fontconfig sudo rpm -i https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/mscorefonts2/rpms/msttcore-fonts-installer-2.6-1.noarch.rpm I also add these fonts to ~/.local/share/fonts since I use them in my terminal emulator and other apps:\nComic Mono SF Mono Nerd Font If not satisfied, there is always the option of adding fonts into the fonts directory from Windows or another Operating System Install GNOME Tweaks This allows us to make some customization changes like adding/removing titlebar buttons (maximize/minimize), changing themes and fonts among other things. I tend to change the Monospace Text font to a Nerd Font.\nsudo dnf install gnome-tweaks In my experience, changing these helps a lot:\nHinting: Slight Antialiasing: Subpixel (this may vary depending on your display setup). Use adw-gtk3 as the theme for legacy apps for them to look more cohesive with other apps using libadwaita.\nInstall Apps and Extensions Apps I use include:\nBrowsers: Firefox (flatpak version), Brave Browser Coding: VS Code, Android Studio, Neovim Gaming: Steam Multimedia: Spotify, VLC, Jellyfin Terminal Emulator: Alacritty (including nautilus-open-any-terminal and starship) Torrent Client: qBittorrent Utilities: htop, Xtreme Download Manager (only for YouTube and large downloads) Others: Discord, Extension Manager, gThumb, ProtonVPN, Solaar (for Logitech peripherals) Afterwards, I remove the extra apps thats I don\u0026rsquo;t need, for me these include totem (GNOME Videos), GNOME Weather, Firefox (pre-installed version), GNOME Terminal etc.\nTypically I play around with some extensions or have mixed feelings about some (*) but these are the extensions that I install from the Extensions Manager app and use:\nAppIndicator and KStatusNotifierItem Support Blur my Shell * Caffeine Dash to Dock GSConnect Pano - Clipboard Manager Rounded Window Corners I do not recommend installing a lot of extensions as they could slow down your system or some could be left unmaintained/lose support across GNOME updates. Firefox Tweaks On Firefox, YouTube shows the scrollbars in fullscreen which makes it very easy for me to accidentally click it and suddenly move down the page. To fix this, I add this line to my uBlock Origin filter:\nwww.youtube.com##ytd-app:style(overflow: hidden !important;) That line disables YouTube\u0026rsquo;s scroll-to-comments \u0026ldquo;feature\u0026rdquo; which to me is not as important but used to be to quickly check video publish date.\nCredit: This Reddit comment\nBy default, hardware acceleration is disabled but head over to about:config and toggle this option:\nmedia.ffmpeg.vaapi.enabled I\u0026rsquo;ve also noticed that the flatpak version of Firefox does not have two finger swipe by default, run this command to fix that:\nsudo flatpak override --env=MOZ_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1 Setup Coding Environment and Dotfiles I usually create a directory in ~ where I set up Flutter and any other SDK in this directory. Afterwards, I create another directory in ~ to store most of my projects.\nAt this point, I clone my dotfiles backup into ~ and run the script to setup my config files.\nMake It Yours Change wallpaper Schedule night light Add online accounts Mute system sounds and mic Switch to 24h clock format Add, reorder and remove items from the dock Anyway, feel free to reach out.\nCheers ✌️\nNote To Self The curled scripts below are meant for my personal use.

Very much like how printing \u0026ldquo;Hello world\u0026rdquo; is usually the first thing one learns when they begin programming.\nI plan on this being more like a frankenstein of a blog and a portfolio - blogfolio, is that even a word? It will host articles on things I find interesting around tech including concept breakdowns, Linux and FOSS or how-tos just for my referral in the future and in the process benefit whoever stumbles upon this.\nAlso, as a side-effect, this website will function as a landing page to replace link aggregators like Linktree that I currently use.\nAs this is a static site, currently a comment section is not implemented and I am not sure if I\u0026rsquo;ll do so. I am weighing up the pros and cons of having it but we\u0026rsquo;ll see how this goes.\nAnyway, feel free to reach out to me.
